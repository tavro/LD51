  subject: Second reminder of loan repayment
  body: 'Hello for the third time dear customer,


    We at the Bank of Unreliable
    Accountants are starting to get impatient at your lack of repayment regarding
    your loan. We are not money hungry, but we would very much like to get back the
    money that you borrowed from us, with our customary 900% interest rate. We hope
    that you will be able to repay us soon. The deadline is in 100 days.


    As
    mentioned before, we accept no excuses. Not even from you, special snowflake.
    Please have a good day.


    Regards,

    Mon Eh Hungry, CEO of the Bank of
    Unreliable Accountants.'
