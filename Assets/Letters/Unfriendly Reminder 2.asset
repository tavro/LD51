  subject: "My Dear, Lovely Karl \xC5ke."
  body: "I am writing to you as the new CEO of the Bank of Money, as the old CEO
    went to prison for murder. I am very happy to have you as one of our Dear Costumers!
    The old CEO left me a letter he was about to send to you, and asked me to make
    sure it got to you before he went to prison.\r\n\nHave a Good Day! :)\r\n\nBest
    Regards,\r\nFlow Erlo Ver.\r\nCEO of the Bank of Happiness and Social Welfare\n\nAttached
    letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xC5ke.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will probably lose this game that you
    are playing. We do not know why you would interpret your life and life savings
    as a game, but nevertheless. You now only have 10 days left to repay your loan
    of 1000 Riksdals. We do not know how you will be able to make it, but We expect
    your money in 10 days AT THE LATEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nYouth these days are so lazy.
    That is why you cannot repay your loan. You only sit around all day, playing
    video games and staring at your computer. You need to learn what it\u2019s like
    to live in our Capitalist society, and start contributing. And give Us your Money."
  author: "Thank you for nothing,\r\r\nTime is Money,\r\nCap I Talism,\r\nCEO of
    the Bank of Time is Money."
