Second Reminder of Repayment of your Loan
Hello for the third time Dear Customer, 
We at the Bank of Unreliable Accountants are starting to get impatient at your lack of repayment of your loan. We are not Money Hungry, but we would very much like to get back the money that you borrowed from us, with our customary 900% interest rate. We hope that you will be able to repay us soon. As mentioned before, we accept no excuses. Not even from you, you Special Snowflake. 
Please have a good day, 
And remember, Time is Money.
Best Regards, 
Mon Eh Hungry,
CEO of the Bank of Unreliable Accountants.
